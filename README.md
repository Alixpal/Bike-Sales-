#### Summary Of Findings

After reviewing the data, I have compiled the following findings,
-	Those classified as middle-aged (31-54) show a higher likelihood of purchasing a bike.
-	Bike purchases are greater in the Pacific region compared to North America and Europe.
-	Individuals currently enrolled in school and commuting between 1 and 2 miles are inclined to buy a bike.

#### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions,

-	Leverage Back-to-School Promotions: Launch a back-to-school campaign to coincide with the start of the academic year. Promote bikes as an essential item for the new semester, along with discounted accessories for a complete commuting solution.
-	Build Community Connections: Develop partnerships with local fitness groups, gyms, or wellness centers to create community events or bike tours. This could attract middle-aged participants and increase engagement.
-	Expand to Suburban Markets: While urban areas have traditionally been the focus, suburban markets are increasingly interested in biking for both recreation and short commutes. Highlight family-oriented or recreational bikes for suburban areas, focusing on biking as a family-friendly activity or an alternative to car-based commutes.
